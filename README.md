# Restart-App
advanced animation onboarding

Restart App objectives :

1. ADVANCED APP DESIGN The main goal of this mini project is to inspire you on what we can accomplish with the SwiftUI framework. 
2. COMPLEX SWIFTUI GESTURES We will create such a custom button with complex gestures that we can not find in Apple’s stock user interface library. 
3. PARALLAX EFFECT By using multiple movements in the opposite direction (parallax effect) we can add depth to this amazing onboarding screen.
